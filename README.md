# so_long

So_Long is a 2D game developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It is a simple implementation of a game where the player navigates through a maze, collecting items and avoiding obstacles. The program showcases graphics rendering, user input handling, and basic game mechanics.

The main objective of So_Long is to create an interactive game that engages the player in exploring a maze-like environment. The game involves moving a character through the maze, collecting objects, and reaching the exit while avoiding enemies or obstacles.

## Key Features:

- Maze rendering: So_Long renders a maze using graphics libraries, displaying walls, floor tiles, objects, and characters.
- Player interaction: The game allows players to control a character within the maze, moving in cardinal directions and interacting with objects.
- Collision detection: So_Long incorporates collision detection to prevent the player from passing through walls or other impassable objects.
- Object collection: The player's goal is to collect objects within the maze, which may grant points or unlock certain game elements.

*By working on So_Long, you will gain hands-on experience in game development concepts, including graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and basic game logic. It provides an opportunity to apply programming skills in a creative and interactive context, allowing you to explore the fundamentals of game design.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a fully-featured commercial game.
